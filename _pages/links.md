### Software Links
Version control of modelling software and code is important to learn
[Getting Started with GitHub](http://kbroman.org/github_tutorial/)

Highly recommend Jupyter as part of the Anaconda Distribution
[Anaconda Distribution](https://www.anaconda.com/download/)

A lot of global data /modelling results come packaged as NetCDF
