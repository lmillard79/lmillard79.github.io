## Hydrological Modeling Expertise

With over 15 years of experience in water resources engineering, I have developed extensive expertise in various hydrological modeling approaches, from conceptual models to complex continuous simulation systems.

### Conceptual Models

**RORB (Runoff Routing)**
- Event-based rainfall-runoff modeling
- Flood frequency analysis
- Regional flood estimation techniques

**URBS (Urban Runoff Block Scheme)**
- Urban catchment modeling
- Real-time flood forecasting
- Integration with Delft FEWS for operational forecasting

### Continuous Simulation Models

**GoldSim**
GoldSim has been a cornerstone of my modeling approach for complex water resource systems:

- **Water Balance Modeling:** Long-term continuous simulation of reservoir systems, irrigation schemes, and mine water management
- **Discrete Event Modeling:** Simulation of operational rules, maintenance schedules, and emergency procedures
- **Level Pool Routing:** Reservoir operation modeling under various release policies
- **Storage Routing:** Complex storage-discharge relationships for natural and constructed water bodies

### Advanced Modeling Applications

**Integration with Forecasting Systems**
- Delft FEWS configuration and adapter development
- Real-time data assimilation
- Automated model execution and result processing

**Model Validation & Uncertainty Analysis**
- Statistical validation of model outputs
- Sensitivity analysis of model parameters
- Bayesian approaches to parameter estimation

## Modeling Philosophy

My approach to hydrological modeling emphasizes:

1. **Fit for Purpose:** Selecting the appropriate modeling approach for each specific application
2. **Data-Driven:** Leveraging available data to inform model development and validation
3. **Transparent:** Clear documentation of assumptions, methods, and limitations
4. **Robust:** Incorporating uncertainty analysis and sensitivity testing

## Software Proficiency

- TUFLOW (1D/2D hydraulic modeling)
- MIKE FLOOD (Integrated flood modeling)
- HEC-RAS (River analysis system)
- InfoWorks RS (Urban drainage modeling)
- XP Rafts (Stormwater modeling)

For examples of how I've applied these tools in real projects, see my [technical blog](/datascience/).
